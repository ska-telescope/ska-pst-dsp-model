The Matlab code in this project serves as a "golden" implementation of the PFB
inversion algorithm used by the PST. This is the reference against which
all other code is compared.

The program :func:`current_performance` is used to assess the performance of the
PST PFB inversion algorithm. This is configured with the ``test.config.json``
file, like the Python tests.
